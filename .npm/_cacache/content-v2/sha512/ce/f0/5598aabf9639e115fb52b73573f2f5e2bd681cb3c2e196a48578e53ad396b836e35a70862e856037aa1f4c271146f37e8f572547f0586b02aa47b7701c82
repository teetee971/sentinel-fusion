You should consider to create your own middleware with [basic-auth](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-basic-auth).\n\n## API\n\n```js\nvar basicAuth = require('basic-auth-connect');\n```\n\nSimple username and password\n\n```js\nconnect()\n.use(basicAuth('username', 'password'));\n```\n\nCallback verification\n\n```js\nconnect()\n.use(basicAuth(function(user, pass){\n  return 'tj' == user && 'wahoo' == pass;\n}))\n```\n\nAsync callback verification, accepting `fn(err, user)`.\n\n```js\nconnect()\n.use(basicAuth(function(user, pass, fn){\n  User.authenticate({ user: user, pass: pass }, fn);\n}))\n```\n\n**Security Considerations**\n\nImportant: When using the callback method, it is recommended to use a time-safe comparison function like [crypto.timingSafeEqual](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#cryptotimingsafeequala-b) to prevent timing attacks.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](./LICENSE)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"sammok2003":true,"sanketss84":true}}
